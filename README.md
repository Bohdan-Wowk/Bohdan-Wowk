- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bohdan! I'm a Uwaterloo Electrical Engineering student, and so far i really really love my program!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in way too many things, from programming to circuit building to music to books, games, film, food, I'm a passionate guy and the list goes on.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the electronics of music!
- Most of my projects aren't actually on here, because they're not noteworthy or on a hard drive that I wiped because I only had 1Tb of storage untill a year ago :)
